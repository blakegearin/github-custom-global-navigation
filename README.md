# GitHub Custom Global Navigation

## Background

In April 2023, GitHub released a public beta for a redesigned global navigation and asked for [feedback](https://github.com/orgs/community/discussions/52083).

In October 2023, GitHub initiated a [public rollout](https://github.blog/changelog/2023-10-17-redesigned-navigation-now-available-to-all-users/) and removed the opt-out from [Release preview](https://docs.github.com/en/get-started/using-github/exploring-early-access-releases-with-feature-preview).
